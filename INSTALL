| 3. configure options and details on building the module              |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

If you run ./configure as a user with a DB2 environment and apxs is in
the path, there's nothing else to worry about.

However, you might have 2 versions of Apache installed and want to
choose for which one the module is for, or you don't have the DB2 env
initialized.

There are options to specify the location of the DB2 home and the
apxs utility:

--with-apxs=FILE                FILE is the pathname of the Apache tool

--with-IBM_DB2=DIR              DIR is the IBM DB2 instance or home
                                directory where the DB2 application
                                development headers and libraries are
                                located

By default man pages are installed automatically, but you can change
this by using the following flag:

--disable-man-pages

During install the module can also be activated in the Apache config
file httpd.conf:

--enable-activation

After successful configuration the module can be installed with:

make install

Be aware that this process needs root privileges.
